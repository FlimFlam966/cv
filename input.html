    <h3><p>When I guide you through this course there will be a few challenges that
    pass by as we go. This skill will help you create your own public games and
    help you get rich. If you do somehow come across a problem you can always
    go to the contacts page and message me. If you don't know how to download
    a workspace even after a tutorial, you can always contact me.</p>
    <br>
     <p>The things I teach your child is going from very mild then to
     intermediate, and finally advanced, so... is Your child ready to take
     on the challenge? While I teach your child I'll be teaching in a
     very fun way so your child doesn't get bored. We'll be providing Your
     child with lots of educational challenges that will both be informative
     and fun. When we're finished with the tutorial for coding you can rate
